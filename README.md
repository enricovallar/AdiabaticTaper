# InP Adiabatic Taper

This repo contains the scripts to:
- realize the geometries, mash and simulation regions for each component (SiN waveguide, InP waveguide, InP taper, SiN taper). Look [waveguide_simulations.py](waveguides_simulations.py)
- realize the full device model and simulation. Look [taperDesigner.py](taperDesigner.py)
- sweep the parameters and save the models
- Map the beta-factor over different width and height of the waveguide.

Documentation is [here](./docs/build/html/index.html). Read it in github page: 
[https://enricovallar.github.io/AdiabaticTaper/](https://enricovallar.github.io/AdiabaticTaper/), but I suggest to download the folder for better visualization (read-the-docs-style)
